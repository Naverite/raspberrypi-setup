# raspberrypi-setup
#Run the script as Sudo ./install.sh
 - This is due to the node exporter section being unable to generate the required file and it failing to finialize the installation.

# Steps: 
- Download the script
- Tar the download with "tar -xzvf "
- give the script executable status with chmod +x
- run the script as Sudo ./install.sh
- Enjoy :)
